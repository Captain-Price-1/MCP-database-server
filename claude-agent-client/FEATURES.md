# Claude Agent Client - Feature Overview

## 🎯 Core Features

### 1. Superior Reasoning with Claude Sonnet 4

**What it means:**
- Claude autonomously explores your database
- Understands business concepts ("family bookings", "VIP users")
- Maps concepts to actual columns without explicit instructions
- Investigates and retries when something fails

**Example:**
```
Query: "How many family bookings in 2023?"

Claude's reasoning:
1. "Family booking" is a business concept, not a column name
2. Let me explore the schema
3. Found: num_kids, party_size columns in reservations
4. Deduced: num_kids > 0 likely indicates family
5. Generated: WHERE num_kids > 0 AND YEAR(created_at) = 2023
6. Result: 245 family bookings ✅
```

No prompt engineering needed!

### 2. Agentic Behavior

**What it means:**
- Claude makes autonomous decisions
- Explores before executing
- Adapts strategy based on results
- Retries with different approaches if needed

**Example:**
```
Query: "Which service was most used in October 2023?"

Claude's actions:
1. Lists all tables → Finds 'reservations' and 'services'
2. Describes 'reservations' → Finds service_id column
3. Describes 'services' → Finds name column
4. Realizes it needs to JOIN for readable results
5. Filters on reservation's created_at (not service's!)
6. Returns service names with counts
```

All automatic!

### 3. Seamless MCP Integration

**What it means:**
- Works with ExecuteAutomation's MCP Database Server as-is
- No modifications to server code needed
- Supports all MCP tools automatically
- Handles STDIO protocol internally

**Supported Databases:**
- ✅ SQLite
- ✅ MySQL / MariaDB
- ✅ PostgreSQL
- ✅ SQL Server

---

### 4. Interactive CLI

**What it means:**
- Beautiful command-line interface
- Real-time streaming responses
- Helpful commands (help, debug, config)
- Color-coded output

**Features:**
```
> help        - Show available commands
> debug       - Toggle debug mode
> config      - Show configuration
> clear       - Clear screen
> quit/exit   - Exit application
```

---

### 5. Advanced Query Patterns

**Semantic Understanding:**
```
"Family bookings"     → num_kids > 0, children > 0
"VIP users"           → tier, level, status checks
"Business customers"  → company_name IS NOT NULL
"Quiet times"         → GROUP BY hour, ORDER BY count ASC
"Popular products"    → GROUP BY product, ORDER BY count DESC
```

**Time Intelligence:**
```
"in 2023"             → YEAR(created_at) = 2023
"last October"        → MONTH(created_at) = 10
"this month"          → Current month logic
"peak hours"          → Hour-based grouping
```

**Relationship Understanding:**
```
"Users who..."        → Finds user table, joins appropriately
"Top customers by..." → Aggregation with ORDER BY
"Products with..."    → Related table joins
```

---

### 6. Human-Readable Results

**What it means:**
- Always JOINs for names (not just IDs)
- Provides context (percentages, totals)
- Shows top N, not just top 1
- Explains the data

**Example:**
```
Query: "Top services in October 2023"

Result:
Top 5 Services in October 2023:

1. Premium Detailing - 89 uses (32.5%)
2. Express Wash - 67 uses (24.5%)
3. Interior Cleaning - 54 uses (19.7%)
4. Wax & Polish - 38 uses (13.9%)
5. Engine Bay Clean - 26 uses (9.5%)

Total reservations: 274
Unique services used: 12
```

Not just: `service_id: 967, count: 89`

---

### 7. Automatic Schema Discovery

**What it means:**
- Claude loads and understands your schema
- Categorizes columns by purpose
- Identifies relationships
- Recognizes naming patterns

**Detection:**
```
Primary Keys:    id, uuid
Foreign Keys:    user_id, creator_id, parent_id
Timestamps:      created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
Booleans:        is_active, has_children, is_deleted
Enums:           status, type, category
Quantities:      num_kids, party_size, amount
```

---

### 8. Error Recovery

**What it means:**
- Claude investigates empty results
- Tries alternative approaches
- Reports accurate issues
- Suggests solutions

**Example:**
```
Query returns 0 rows:

Claude's investigation:
1. Check if data exists for time period → Found data
2. Check if using wrong date column → Was using junction table!
3. Switch to primary entity's created_at
4. Re-run query → Success!
```

---

### 9. Multi-Database Support

**Configuration Examples:**

**SQLite:**
```env
DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
DATABASE_PATH=../data/test.db
```

**MySQL (Laravel):**
```env
DATABASE_TYPE=mysql
DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
DATABASE_PORT=3306
DATABASE_NAME=laravel
DATABASE_USER=root
DATABASE_PASSWORD=root
```

**PostgreSQL:**
```env
DATABASE_TYPE=postgresql
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=mydb
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=password
```

**SQL Server:**
```env
DATABASE_TYPE=sqlserver
DATABASE_SERVER=localhost
DATABASE_NAME=mydb
DATABASE_USER=sa
DATABASE_PASSWORD=YourPassword
```

---

### 10. Streaming Responses

**What it means:**
- Real-time output as Claude thinks
- See reasoning process (optional)
- Immediate feedback
- Cancel anytime

**Example:**
```
> Analyze user behavior patterns

Claude: Let me start by exploring the database...
[streaming]
Found users table with login history...
[streaming]
Analyzing patterns...
[streaming]
Results: [final output]
```
