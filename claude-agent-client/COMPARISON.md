## 🧠 Reasoning Capabilities

### The "Family Bookings" Test

**Query**: "How many family bookings in 2023?"

#### OpenAI Client Behavior:
```
1. Reads prompt with 700+ lines of instructions
2. Tries to map "family" to column names
3. Might hallucinate: WHERE type = 'family' ❌
4. Returns 0 rows
5. Needs manual prompt tuning
```

**Result**: Struggles without explicit mapping in prompt

#### Claude Agent Client Behavior:
```
1. Explores database schema autonomously
2. Reasons: "Family likely means children"
3. Finds: num_kids, children, party_size columns
4. Deduces: num_kids > 0 indicates family ✅
5. Generates correct SQL
6. Returns accurate count
```

**Result**: Works naturally without special instructions

## 💰 Cost Comparison

### Per 1000 Queries Estimate

Assumptions:
- Average query: 1000 input tokens, 500 output tokens
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: $0.15/1M input, $0.60/1M output
- Claude Sonnet 4: $3.00/1M input, $15.00/1M output

#### OpenAI Client:
```
Input:  1000 queries × 1000 tokens × $0.15/1M  = $0.15
Output: 1000 queries × 500 tokens × $0.60/1M   = $0.30
Total: $0.45 per 1000 queries
```

#### Claude Agent Client:
```
Input:  1000 queries × 1000 tokens × $3.00/1M  = $3.00
Output: 1000 queries × 500 tokens × $15.00/1M  = $7.50
Total: $10.50 per 1000 queries
```

**Claude is ~23x more expensive** 

But:
- Fewer failed queries (better reasoning)
- Less developer time (no prompt engineering)
- Better user experience (accurate results)
