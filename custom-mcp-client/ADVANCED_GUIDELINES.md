# Advanced Query Guidelines - Added to LLM Prompt

## What Was Added

I've added **6 critical advanced guidelines** to the OpenAI prompt to prevent common query mistakes, especially around:
- Date filtering on wrong tables
- Missing JOINs for readable results
- Empty result investigation
- Counting precision
- JOIN type selection
- Context provision

These guidelines are now **permanently embedded** in the LLM's system prompt and will be applied to every query.

## The 6 Advanced Guidelines

### üìÖ GUIDELINE 1: Date Filtering on Correct Tables

**The Problem:**
Junction/relationship tables (like `reservation_services`, `order_items`) have their own `created_at` timestamp that represents when the **LINK** was created, NOT when the main entity was created.

**The Solution:**
Always filter dates on the **PRIMARY ENTITY** table:

```sql
-- ‚ùå WRONG: Filtering on relationship table
SELECT service_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM reservation_services 
WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2023  -- This is when the LINK was created!
GROUP BY service_id;

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Filter on primary entity, then join
SELECT rs.service_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM reservations r                    -- Primary entity
JOIN reservation_services rs ON r.id = rs.reservation_id
WHERE YEAR(r.created_at) = 2023       -- When reservation was created
GROUP BY rs.service_id;
```

**Table Classification:**
- **PRIMARY ENTITIES**: reservations, orders, users ‚Üí Filter dates HERE
- **JUNCTION TABLES**: reservation_services, order_items ‚Üí DON'T filter dates here
- **REFERENCE TABLES**: services, products, categories ‚Üí Lookup data

---

### üîó GUIDELINE 2: Always JOIN for Human-Readable Results

**The Problem:**
User asks "Which service was most used?" but query returns `service_id: 967` (meaningless without context).

**The Solution:**
ALWAYS JOIN to reference tables to get names/descriptions:

```sql
-- ‚ùå WRONG: Returns meaningless IDs
SELECT service_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM reservation_services
GROUP BY service_id;

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Includes service names
SELECT 
    ss.id as service_id,
    ss.name as service_name,      -- Human-readable!
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM reservation_services rs
JOIN shop_services ss ON rs.service_id = ss.id
GROUP BY ss.id, ss.name;
```

**When to JOIN:**
- Question asks for "name", "title", "description"
- Result would show only IDs
- User needs context to understand results

---

### üîç GUIDELINE 3: Investigate Empty Results

**The Problem:**
Query returns 0 rows, LLM just says "No results found" without investigating why.

**The Solution:**
Follow this investigation protocol:

**Step 1** - Verify data exists:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(created_at), MAX(created_at)
FROM primary_table
WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2023;
```

**Step 2** - Check if wrong date column:
- Are you filtering on junction table instead of entity?
- Check which `created_at` you're using

**Step 3** - Test without time filter:
- Remove date filter temporarily to see if data exists

**Step 4** - Sample raw data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 5;
```

Then **adjust query** based on findings or **report accurate issue** to user.

---

### üé≤ GUIDELINE 4: Count the Right Thing

**The Problem:**
Being imprecise about what you're counting leads to wrong results.

**The Solution:**
Be precise:

```sql
-- "How many RESERVATIONS used service X?"
COUNT(DISTINCT reservation_id)  -- Count unique reservations

-- "How many TIMES was service X used?"
COUNT(*)                        -- Count all occurrences

-- "How many UNIQUE SERVICES were used?"
COUNT(DISTINCT service_id)      -- Count unique services
```

---

### üîÑ GUIDELINE 5: INNER vs LEFT JOIN Decision

**When to use INNER JOIN:**
- Relationship MUST exist
- Counting related entities
- Want to EXCLUDE records without relationships

**When to use LEFT JOIN:**
- Want to include records EVEN WITHOUT relationships
- Counting "all X, including those without Y"
- Need to show NULL for missing data

**Examples:**
```sql
-- "Reservations with services" ‚Üí INNER JOIN
-- "All reservations, show services if any" ‚Üí LEFT JOIN
```

---

### üìä GUIDELINE 6: Provide Context, Not Just Minimum Answer

**The Problem:**
Only returning top 1 result without context.

**The Solution:**
Provide comprehensive results:

```sql
-- ‚ùå MINIMAL: Only top result
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM ... ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1;

-- ‚úÖ BETTER: Top 5-10 with percentages and totals
SELECT 
    name,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM ...
GROUP BY name
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Include in explanation:**
- Direct answer to question
- Top N results (not just top 1)
- Totals for context
- Any caveats or assumptions

## Anti-Patterns Now Explicitly Flagged

The LLM is now trained to avoid these common mistakes:

1. ‚ùå Date filter on junction table (use primary entity!)
2. ‚ùå Returning only IDs (JOIN to get names!)
3. ‚ùå Accepting empty results (investigate why!)
4. ‚ùå Counting wrong metric (be precise!)
5. ‚ùå Over-limiting results (show top 10, not just 1)
6. ‚ùå Ignoring NULLs (handle explicitly!)

---

## Golden Rules Summary

The LLM now follows these golden rules for every query:

1. **Primary Entity First**: Filter dates on main entity, not relationships
2. **Always JOIN for Names**: If question asks for names, JOIN to references
3. **Validate Empty Results**: 0 rows = investigate, don't just report
4. **Provide Context**: Show top N, totals, percentages
5. **Be Precise**: Count the right thing, use correct JOIN type
6. **Handle Edge Cases**: NULLs, soft deletes, time zones

## How This Improves Your Queries

### Before (Without Guidelines):

**Query:** "Which service was most used in October 2023?"

```sql
-- ‚ùå Problems:
SELECT service_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM reservation_services
WHERE YEAR(created_at) = 2023 AND MONTH(created_at) = 10
GROUP BY service_id
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 1;

Issues:
1. Returns only ID (967) - not readable
2. Filters on junction table date - wrong!
3. Only shows top 1 - no context
```

### After (With Guidelines):

**Query:** "Which service was most used in October 2023?"

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Correct:
SELECT 
    ss.id as service_id,
    ss.name as service_name,
    COUNT(*) as usage_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM reservations r                              -- Primary entity!
JOIN reservation_services rs ON r.id = rs.reservation_id
JOIN shop_services ss ON rs.service_id = ss.id  -- Get names!
WHERE YEAR(r.created_at) = 2023                 -- Filter on entity date
  AND MONTH(r.created_at) = 10
GROUP BY ss.id, ss.name
ORDER BY usage_count DESC
LIMIT 10;                                        -- Top 10 with context

Benefits:
1. Returns service names - readable!
2. Filters on primary entity date - correct!
3. Shows top 10 with percentages - context!
```

## Real-World Example

### Your "Family Bookings" Query

**Before advanced guidelines:**
- Might use wrong date column
- Might miss data due to incorrect JOIN
- Might not investigate if 0 rows returned

**After advanced guidelines:**
- Filters on `reservations.created_at` (primary entity)
- Uses correct JOIN to get service names if needed
- If 0 rows, investigates why before reporting

---

## Testing the Guidelines

### Test Case 1: Service Usage Query
```
Query: "Which service was most used in October 2023?"

Expected Behavior:
1. ‚úÖ Identifies 'reservations' as primary entity
2. ‚úÖ Filters date on reservations.created_at
3. ‚úÖ JOINs to shop_services for names
4. ‚úÖ Returns top 10 with percentages
5. ‚úÖ Provides context and totals
```

### Test Case 2: Empty Results
```
Query: "Services used in December 2025?"

Expected Behavior (if no data):
1. ‚úÖ Checks if data exists for 2025
2. ‚úÖ Verifies date column is correct
3. ‚úÖ Samples raw data
4. ‚úÖ Reports: "No reservations found for 2025" (not just "0 rows")
```

### Test Case 3: ID vs Name
```
Query: "Top users who made reservations?"

Expected Behavior:
1. ‚úÖ JOINs to users table for first_name/last_name
2. ‚úÖ Returns names, not just user_id
3. ‚úÖ Shows top 10, not just top 1
```

3. Human-readable results (JOINs for names)
4. Empty result investigation (diagnostic protocol)
5. Precise metrics (COUNT vs COUNT DISTINCT)
6. Contextual responses (top N, percentages, totals)

These guidelines are **permanently embedded** and will apply to **every query** automatically! üéØ
